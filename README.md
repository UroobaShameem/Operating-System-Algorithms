# Round Robbin Algorithm
The Round Robin scheduling algorithm is a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm commonly used in computer operating systems and multitasking environments. 
It's designed to provide fair distribution of CPU time among multiple processes or tasks by assigning each process a fixed time slice or quantum before moving on to the next process. 
This prevents any single process from monopolizing the CPU for an extended period.
